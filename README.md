# Coder-Zombies
TechSpardha

This is the project based on Web Development and Deep Learning .

I, along with my team 'Coder Zombies' created this project for the hackathon organized by Technobyte, NIT Kurukshetra .

# Idealogy

To overcome the biggest problem of online teaching is that educator can't see the expression of student and hence can't recognize the porblem student is facing and modify the teaching technique.
For that we have created a ML based website where one can detect emotion of a student and accordingly will send message of its emotion to the educator who is teaching him or her.

# Future Scope

We can connect it with a online video confressing platforms for the direct connection to the meeting. 
Connect the Detection feature directly to the site.

# Dependencies

1. Keras

2. Tensorflow

3. Flask

4. cv2

5. Nummpy
